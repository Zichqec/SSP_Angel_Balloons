# SSP Angel Balloons
These balloons were made to go with the ghost [SSP Angel](https://github.com/Zichqec/SSP_Angel). You can download them individually here, or have the ghost download and install them for you through its balloon settings menu.

## Angelbox
Angelbox is a plain angel-themed balloon, with different colors for each character. It is the default balloon that comes with the ghost, and has no additional features. It focuses on having a clean and simple look, excellent readability, and a large text area.

## Angelbox (Biblically Accurate)
Angelbox (Biblically Accurate) is an expanded version of the Angelbox balloon, having 43 color options. Each color option includes special markers, arrows, etc., giving this balloon a rather large footprint at over 800 files. The default balloon color option is a mixture of the sakura and kero balloons from the original Angelbox, with the individual versions available as alternate colors.
